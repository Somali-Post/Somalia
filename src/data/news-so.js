      MOGADISHU -- In a watershed moment for Somalia's democratization process, residents of the capital city cast their ballots yesterday in the first direct, one-person, one-vote municipal elections since 1969.

      The National Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (NIEBC) reported that polling stations across the 16 districts of the Banadir region opened peacefully. Over 1,600 candidates from 20 political parties competed for 390 local council seats.

      "This is not just an election; it is the restoration of the Somali voice," said President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in a televised address. "Today, we leave behind the era of selection and embrace the era of election."

      Voter turnout was robust, with long queues forming at dawn. The election is seen as a critical test run for the planned national federal elections in 2026, signaling a decisive shift away from the clan-based indirect voting system. International observers from the African Union and UN have commended the peaceful conduct of the process.

      ARUSHA -- The Federal Republic of Somalia has officially deposited its instrument of ratification, formally becoming the 8th member state of the East African Community (EAC).

      This historic accession integrates Somalia into a market of over 300 million people. It opens the door for free movement of goods, services, and people across the region, boosting trade opportunities for Somali businesses.

      "Somalia belongs to East Africa, and East Africa belongs to Somalia," the President stated during the ceremony. The move is expected to attract significant investment in Somalia's blue economy and infrastructure sectors.

      WASHINGTON D.C. -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) have confirmed that Somalia has reached the Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.

      This milestone results in debt service relief of $4.5 billion, reducing the country's external debt from 64% of GDP in 2018 to less than 6% by the end of 2023.

      "This is a new dawn for Somalia's economic future," said the Minister of Finance. "We are now able to access concessional financing to build roads, schools, and hospitals for our people."
